Story 16 refers to sending an email to the student when the appointment is cancelled.
This Spike Task demonstrates options for how to send emails as well as resources for assistance with implementation.

Current Situation:
- React JS apps are run on the client-side (in a browser) and the SMTP server needs to be set up on the server-side. 
- In theory, you could provide your SMTP credentials on the client-side, directly in the code but will be exposing sensitive data
which is not appropriates.

Alternatives:
- External tool called: EmailJS to handle sending emails
    -  lets you connect your email client in the browser, build a template and send it with EmailJS API.
    - There are lots of email services you can use it with, including Gmail and Outlook. 
    - Pricings for each differ and most come with a free, limited tier.

    Steps:
    1. To get started, create an EmailJS account 
    2. start building your first templates with the built-in email template editor. 
    3. add EmailJS to your React project.
    4. Setup email sending. 

Great resources to look before implementing:
